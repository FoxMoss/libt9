# LibT9
A C library for creating [T9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_%28predictive_text%29) typing systems.

## Dependencies
None! The library requires nothing but a basic implementation of the C standard
library. The CLI requires ncurses solely, but this is by no means needed to
just compile the library.

## Todo
Feel free to contribute!

- [ ] Punctuation
- [ ] IBus Driver
- [ ] Support for non-words
